# Goatify Music Player

Goatify is an online music player 'proof of concept' that was created as a classroom project. 

# Goatify Description

Goatify is an online music player. The idea was to create a project where a user could have an account, save playlists, and play music. The web app was created using vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and an SQL Database. A few challenges that we faced were learning the needed technologies (they were new to us at the time), the SQL relationships, and playlist logic. A feature that we hope to implement in the future is being able to connect your Spotify Account. 

# How to Use Goatify 

To test out Goatify you can use public@goatify.com for the email and goatify for the password. You can play around with the features such as viewing a playlist, playing a song, searching songs, creating/deleting playlists or anything else you can find.
